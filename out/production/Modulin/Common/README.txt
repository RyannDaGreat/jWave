Notes about my code:
The Synth Module has many modules, with public doubles or objects in them without set/get methods. This is because it's verbose, and anything that is not intended to be get or set will be either final (read-only) or private. In other words, any public variables are meant to be set/get at will.

Δ≣"change in/of"
