# jWave
A real-time modular synthesizer built for Java! 
jWave gives you complete control over the sounds you make, even sample-per-sample if you want!
It can run in realtime, and also output .wav files. 
#Getting Started
A good place to get started is to clone this repository into some IDE like intellij, then compile and run Examples.java 
From there, have fun! Let me know if you're interested in seeing further documentation!
